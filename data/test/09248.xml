                    <abstract>This survey of West German respondents elicited their
opinions on West Germany and its relationship with the United States
and other countries. Topics covered include the respondent's view of
Helmut Kohl's handling of his job as chancellor of West Germany,
impressions of political leaders, the political leader most
interested in arms control, and Gorbachev's motives in relationships
with western countries. In addition, respondents were asked which
countries they thought were working for peace, which countries were
more involved in unrest, and which countries were friends to West
Germany. They also were queried about whether there was a need to
change West Germany's foreign policy, whether the Soviets should
reduce their conventional forces in Europe, whether NATO was
necessary for the defense of Western Europe, and whether the cold war
between West and East was coming to an end. Views on the United
States' short-range nuclear weapons and on American troops in West
Germany also were included. Background information on respondents
includes region and age.</abstract>
