                    <abstract>Cognition and Aging in the USA (CogUSA) is a national longitudinal study of cognition, focused on the age-related changes in cognition across cohorts and on the impact of cognition on key health and economic outcomes. The aim of the CogUSA Study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of tests in assessing cognitive skills on a sample mirroring the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) (ICPSR 6854). Data were derived in three waves, with each wave utilizing a variety of measures. In Waves 1 and 3, these measures included an adaptive number series test. The Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-III) number series test and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) were used in Wave 2. Waves 1 and 3 were conducted as telephone interviews, while Wave 2 was conducted as an in-person interview. This collection includes indicators of cognitive abilities and functioning as well as a variety of demographic, health, and economic variables.
Dataset 1 presents participant demographic information, and Dataset 2 presents scores calculated for the cognitive tests administered to the respondents in each of the three waves.</abstract>
                    <abstract>The goals of CogUSA were: (1) to develop efficient
methods of assessing well-recognized components of intelligence and personality that can be administered by surveys using either face-to-face or telephone administration; and (2) to collect multivariate information to better understand how various cognitive abilities change with age.</abstract>
                    <abstract>The CogUSA Study consists of three survey components. Initial contact was established by telephone calls to selected households, and the study began with a 40-minute telephone interview (Wave 1) that replicated the sections of the HRS questionnaire on demography, health and cognition, and added a few brief cognitive tests. This Wave 1 telephone survey was followed as quickly as possible - ideally, within a week - by a 3 hour face-to-face cognitive assessment (Wave 2) of the cognitive abilities of respondents on a large number of different tasks measuring components of "fluid and crystallized intelligence" (after Horn and McArdle, 2007). Respondents were paid $20 for participation in the Wave 1 interview and $60 for the longer Wave 2 interview. Data collection for Wave 1 took
place between May and December, 2007. A second telephone survey (Wave 3) took place at a randomized interval of 1 to 24 months following the personal interview (following the Timelag strategy of McArdle and Woodcock, 1997). Randomizations for the Wave 3 telephone interview were done at the respondent, not household, level. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of eight follow-up target dates. Wave 3 telephone interviews began in February, 2008 and continued through September, 2009.</abstract>
